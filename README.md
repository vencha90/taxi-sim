## Taxi-sim
### Q-Learner simulation for taxi markets with no price regulation
------------------
A final year undergraduate project for the degree of BSc (Honours) in Computing Science (Business Computing) at the [Department of Computing Science] of the [University of Aberdeen].

Please see the [Report] for a project abstract and a detailed description of the project. Included in the report but also available separately are:

- a [User Manual] for instructions on basic usage of the software,
- a [Maintenance Manual] for instructions on advanced usage and development help.

The results of the experiments are available here: [Result Dataset]

### Software Dependencies
-------------------------

I recommend you to use automatically provisioned virtualisation as specified in the User Manual. Alternatively, on supported Unix-like systems you can use [RVM] or [rbenv].

Uses [Ruby] version 2.1.1

Uses [Rubygems] version 2.2.2

Please see [Gemfile] for the top level depencencies and [Gemfile.lock] for a full list of all dependencies.

### Data Analysis
